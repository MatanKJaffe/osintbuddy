## Joining the community

[Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/gsbbYHA3K3) where you can connect with fellow OSINT enthusiasts, exchange ideas, get help, and discuss the OSINTBuddy application. Our Discord server offers dedicated channels for various topics, including general discussions, bug reporting, and feature requests. People are encouraged to ask questions, share their experiences, and or contribute to the development of the application.

By joining the OSINTBuddy community, you'll not only gain access to insider dev logs and support but also have the opportunity to contribute to the development and growth of this platform.

## Bug reporting
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jerlendds/osintbuddy/issues/new?assignees=jerlendds&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+); it's that easy! **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Error logs wrapped in code blocks
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports! I'm not even kidding.

## Reporting Security Issues
 Please email the core contributors directly at [theosintbuddyproject@openinfolabs.com](mailto:theosintbuddyproject@openinfolabs.com) directly if you encounter a serious security issue (e.g. in a package we use, etc)
